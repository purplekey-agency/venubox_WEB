          By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all the

          Subscribers, and change eligibility requirements at any time.
        </p>
        <h5>2. Term</h5>
        <p>
          When you sign up for an account and agree to these Terms, the
          Agreement between you and OutOut is formed, and the term of the
          Agreement (the &ldquo;Term&rdquo;) will begin. The Term will continue
          for as long as you have a OutOut account or until you or we terminate
          the Agreement in accordance with these Terms, whichever happens first.
          If you sign up for an account on behalf of a company or other entity,
          you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these
          Terms and enter into the Agreement on its behalf.
        </p>
        <h5>3. Closing Your Account</h5>
        <p>
          You or OutOut may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any
          reason by terminating your OutOut account or giving notice to the
          other party. We may suspend the Service to you at any time, with or
          without cause. If we terminate your account without cause, and your
          account is a paid account, we&rsquo;ll refund a prorated portion of
          your monthly prepayment for a Monthly Plan or reimburse you for unused
          Pay as You Go (&ldquo;PAYG&rdquo;) Credits. We won&rsquo;t refund or
          reimburse you in any other situation, including if your account is
          suspended or terminated for cause, such as for a breach or violation
          of the Agreement. If your account is inactive for 24 or more months,
          we may terminate your account and you won&rsquo;t be entitled to a
          refund for a prepaid month or reimbursement for unused Pay as You Go
          Credits. Once your account is terminated, you acknowledge and agree
          that we may permanently delete your account and all the data
          associated with it, including your Campaigns. Usernames are unique and
          can only be used once. If your account has been terminated, the
          username will no longer be available for use on any future accounts
          and cannot be reclaimed.
        </p>
        <h5>4. Changes</h5>
        <p>
          We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on our OutOut
          Site. Unless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be
          effective immediately upon posting and apply to any continued or new
          use of the Service. We may change the Service, Add-ons, or any
          features of the Service at any time, and we may discontinue the
          Service, Add-ons, or any features of the Service at any time.
        </p>
        <h5>5. Account and Password</h5>
        <p>
          You&rsquo;re responsible for keeping your account name and password
          confidential. You&rsquo;re also responsible for any account that you
          have access to and any activity occurring in such account (other than
          activity that OutOut is directly responsible for that isn&rsquo;t
          performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you
          authorized that activity. You&rsquo;ll immediately notify us of any
          unauthorized access or use of your accounts. We&rsquo;re not
          responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We
          don&rsquo;t have access to your current password, and for security
          reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to reset
          your password. We have the right to update any of your contact
          information in your account for billing purposes. In addition, you
          represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you
          establish an account, and when you access and use the Service, is and
          will remain complete and accurate. We may contact you, or any seat,
          authorized user, or login added to your account, based on the
          information provided in your account.
        </p>
        <h5>6. Account Disputes</h5>
        <p>
          We don&rsquo;t know the inner workings of your organization or the
          nature of your personal relationships. You won&rsquo;t request access
          to or information about an account that&rsquo;s not yours, and
          you&rsquo;ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the
          other party. We decide who owns an account based on a number of
          factors, including the content in that account, and the contact and
          profile information listed for that account. In cases where differing
          contact and profile information is present or we are unable to
          reasonably determine ownership, we&rsquo;ll require you to resolve the
          matter through proper channels outside of OutOut.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated
          with the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities,
          to protect the security and privacy of the data held within the
          account until the dispute is properly resolved.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <h5>7. Pay As You Go (PAYG) Promotor Package Plans</h5>
        <p>
          If you use the Service under the Pay As You Go Promotor Package
          (&ldquo;PAYG&rdquo;), you will be limited to one-time usage of the
          platform for one promotion, so no Term applies as such. You are
          subject to the limitations that are outlined in the details associated
          on the Subscription Plan with respects to the Service. To run a
          Promotion over several time periods, you&rsquo;ll be required to
          upgrade your account to, and select and pay for, a Seasonal Plan, or a
          Monthly Plan. Monthly Plans are described in Section 9 below.
        </p>
        <h5>8. Seasonal Plans</h5>
        <p>
          If you use the Service under the Seasonal Plan
          (&ldquo;Seasonal&rdquo;), you will be limited to usage of the platform
          for a 3-month Term. You are subject to the limitations that are
          outlined in the details associated on the Subscription Plan with
          respects to the Service. You&rsquo;ll can upgrade your account to, and
          select and pay for, a Monthly Plan at any point during using the
          Service.
        </p>
        <h5>9. Monthly Plans</h5>
        <p>
          When you sign up for a paid monthly plan, you are required to
          self-select your package Seasonal Package, Premium Package and
          Platinum Package (&ldquo;Monthly Plan&rdquo;) from those posted on our
          OutOut Site based on your anticipated use of the Service. Each Monthly
          Plan offers different pricing and feature options. Once you select
          your Monthly Plan, OutOut will never automatically upgrade or
          downgrade your Monthly Plan. So, give yourself room to grow if
          you&rsquo;ll need it! You will always have the option to upgrade to a
          higher tier at any time, but downgrading a monthly plan is not
          permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you sign up for a Monthly Plan, you agree to monthly recurring
          billing, starting on the date you sign up. Billing occurs on the same
          day each month, based on the date that you started your Monthly Plan.
          Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day
          you made your first monthly payment (the &ldquo;Pay Date&rdquo;). If
          any part of a month is included in the Term, then payment is required
          for the full month.
        </p>
        <h5>10. Debit and Credit Cards</h5>
        <p>
          As long as you&rsquo;re a Subscriber with a Monthly Plan or otherwise
          have an outstanding balance with us, you&rsquo;ll provide us with
          valid debit or credit card (&ldquo;card&rdquo;) information and
          authorize us to deduct your charges against that card. You&rsquo;ll
          replace the information for any card that expires with information for
          a valid one. If your card is automatically replaced with a new card by
          a payment processor, you acknowledge and agree that we&rsquo;re
          authorized to deduct any charges on your account against the new card.
          Anyone using a card represents and warrants that they are authorized
          to use that card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that
          card and won&rsquo;t be rejected. If we&rsquo;re unable to process
          your card order, we&rsquo;ll try to contact you by email and may
          suspend your account until your payment can be processed.
        </p>
        <h5>11. Billing Changes</h5>
        <p>
          We may change our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and
          PAYG, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our OutOut
          Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by email. If
          you are in a Seasonal Plan, or Monthly Plan we will honour the pricing
          declared at the point of First Registration until the end of the Term.
          Following the end of the Term, unless notice is provided, you will
          automatically be billed for the renewal Term at the newly promoted
          price.
        </p>

        <h5>12. Feedback and Proprietary Rights</h5>
        <p>
          We own all proprietary rights in the Service, including, but not
          limited to, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets,

        </p>
        <h5>17. Compliance with Laws</h5>

        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <h5>18. Limitation of Liability</h5>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that
          (i) you assume full responsibility for any loss that results from your
          use of the Service, including any downloads from the OutOut Site; (ii)
          we and our Team won&rsquo;t be liable for any indirect, punitive,
          special, or consequential damages under any circumstances, even if

          possibility of those damages; and (iii) in any calendar month, our
          total liability to you arising under or in connection with the
          Agreement&mdash;whether in contract, tort (including negligence),
          breach of statutory duty, or otherwise&mdash;will be no more than what
          you paid us for the Service the preceding month.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the avoidance of doubt, in no instance will we or our Team be
          liable for any losses or damages you suffer if you use the Service in
          violation of these Terms, regardless of whether we terminate or
          suspend your account due to such violation.
        </p>
        <h5>19. No Warranties</h5>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we provide the Service as-is.
          This means that, except as expressly stated in these Terms, we
          don&rsquo;t provide warranties, conditions, or undertakings of any
          kind in relation to the Service, either express or implied. This
          includes, but isn&rsquo;t limited to, warranties of merchantability
          and fitness for a particular purpose, which are, to the fullest extent
          permitted by law, excluded from the Agreement. Since Subscribersuse
          the Service for a variety of reasons, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that
          it&rsquo;ll meet your specific needs.
        </p>
        <h5>20. Indemnity</h5>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold us and our Team harmless from any
          losses, including legal fees and expenses that directly or indirectly
          result from any claims you make that aren&rsquo;t allowed under these
          Terms due to a &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; or other
          provision. (Indemnity is an agreement to compensate someone for a
          loss.) You also agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any
          losses, including legal fees and expenses, that directly or indirectly
          result from (i) your Content, (ii) your use of the Service, (iii) your
          violation of any laws or regulations, (iv) third-party claims that you
          or someone using your password did something that, if true, would
          violate any of these Terms, (v) any misrepresentations made by you, or
          (vi) a breach of any representations or warranties you&rsquo;ve made
          to us.
        </p>
        <h5>23. Disclaimers</h5>

          connection with the Service (each, a &ldquo;Third-Party
          Integration&rdquo;). Your use of any Third-Party Integration and
          rights with respect to such Third-Party Integration are solely between
          you and the applicable third party. We are not responsible for the

          practices and policies of any Third-Party Integration. We make no
          warranties of any kind and assume no liability of any kind for your
          use of any Third-Party Integration.

          else. We may assign our rights to any other individual or entity at
          our discretion.
        </p>
        <h5>25. Choice of Law</h5>
        <p>
          The United Kingdom&rsquo;s laws, except for conflict of laws rules,
          will apply to any dispute related to the Agreement or the Service. You
          acknowledge and agree that any dispute related to the Agreement or the
          Service itself will be decided by the United Kingdom judicial system,
          and each party consents to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
        </p>
        <h5>26. Force Majeure</h5>
        <p>
          We won&rsquo;t be held liable for any delays or failure in performance
          of any part of the Service, from any cause beyond our control. This
          includes, but is not limited to, acts of god, changes to law or
          regulations, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, riots, fires,
          earthquakes, nuclear accidents, pandemics, floods, strikes, power
          blackouts, unusually severe weather conditions, and acts of hackers,

        </p>
        <h5>27. Survivability</h5>
        <p>
          Even if this Agreement is terminated, the following sections will
          continue to apply: Feedback and Proprietary Rights, Compliance with
          Laws, Limitation of Liability, No Warranties, Indemnity, Choice of
          Law, Severability, and Entire Agreement.
        </p>
        <h5>28. Severability</h5>
        <p>
          If it turns out that a section of these Terms isn&rsquo;t enforceable,
          then that section will be removed or edited as little as required, and
          the rest of the Agreement will still be valid.
        </p>
        <h5>29. Interpretation</h5>
        <p>
          The headertext are provided only to make these Terms easier to read
          and understand. The fact that we wrote these Terms won&rsquo;t affect
          the way the Agreement is interpreted.
        </p>
        <h5>30. Waiver</h5>
        <p>
          If we don&rsquo;t immediately take action on a violation of these
          Terms, we&rsquo;re not giving up any rights under the Terms, and we
          may still take action at some point.
        </p>
        <h5>31. No Changes in Terms at Request of Subscriber</h5>
        <p>
          These Terms apply to all Subscribers to the Service, and so, no
          changes will be provided to these Terms for any one Subscriber or
          Group.
        </p>
        <h5>32. Further Actions</h5>
        <p>
          You&rsquo;ll provide all documents and take any actions necessary to
          meet your obligations under these Terms.
        </p>
        <h5>33. Notification of Security Incident</h5>
        <p>
          If we become aware of a security incident related to our systems or
          databases that contain personal information of you or your contacts,
          we&rsquo;ll notify you if required by law. In that event, we&rsquo;ll
          also provide you with information about that incident so that you can
          evaluate the consequences to you and any legal or regulatory
          requirements that may apply to you, unless we&rsquo;re prevented from
          doing so by legal, security or confidentiality obligations. Notifying
          you of a security incident or cooperating with you to respond to one
          will not be deemed an acknowledgement or assumption of any liability
          or fault of OutOut for such incident.
        </p>
        <h5>34. Notices</h5>
        <p>
          Any notice to you will be effective when we send it to the last email
          address you gave us or when registered on our OutOutWebApp. Any notice
          to us will be effective when delivered to us along with a copy to our

          policies.
