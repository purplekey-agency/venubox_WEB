Anyone using a card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process your card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your account until your payment can be processed.</span>

  <span class="description">We may change our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and PAYG, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our VenuBox Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by email.

Following the end of the Term, unless notice is provided, you will automatically be billed for the renewal Term at the newly promoted price.</span>
