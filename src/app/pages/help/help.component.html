  <h2 class="title">Venubox Web Portal Usage Guide</h2>
  <h4 class="subtitle">The Home Dashboard</h4>
  <span class="description">The home dashboard you arrive at post registration is made up of a number of components.</span>
  <h5 class="section-title">Promotion Performance</h5>
  <span class="description">This section shows the performance of all your active Promotional Offers.</span>
  <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/promotionPerformance1.png" />
  <span class="description">The metrics it provides you with are as follows:</span>
  
  <table border = "1">
    <tr>
       <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Offers Delivered</td>
       <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This metric is the number of offers which were live and delivered to a person with the Venubox consumer mobile app installed on their device.  Delivery of the offer is based on them expressing an interest in your business category (e.g., restaurant, bar) and their physical location (e.g., within a geofence region that you have defined).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
       <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Offers Viewed</td>
       <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">When an Offer is delivered to the mobile app, it is accompanied by a simple push notification, informing the consumer that they have received an offer.  The Offer is delivered into an Offer inbox, within the Venubox mobile app.  This metric is the number of times that someone has opened and physically viewed your Offer that was Delivered.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Total Live Offers</td>
      <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This is the number of Offers that are currently Live, which means they have a Start Date and End Date range that means it is active, and could be delivered to users of the Venubox consumer mobile app.</td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 <span class="description">All of the above metrics default to providing numbers based on “today”.  You can select optionally different time periods to adjust all of the above metrics, for instance “This Week”, or “This Month” so you can track the performance of your Offer over time.</span>
 
 <h5 class="section-title">Recent Promotions</h5>
 <span class="description">This window provides a list of all recent Promotional Offers that were Live.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/promotionPerformance2.png" />
 <span class="description">As with the Promotion Performance section, the list of Offers defaults to providing the list of Offers based on “today”.  You can select optionally different time periods to filter the list of recent, for instance “This Week”, or “This Month” so you can see which Offers were Live across different time frames.</span>
 <h5 class="section-title">Activities</h5>
 <span class="description">The Activities panel provides you quick access to the main functionality of the porta, namely, Brand Identity, Geofences, Offers and Chat.  A description of these capabilities is provided in detail in the sections that follow.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/activities.png" />
 <h5 class="section-title">Subscription Plan</h5>
 <span class="description">This details the Subscription plan that you have subscribed to.  For registrations with no paid Subscription, or that Subscription term has ended, the portal will be greyed out.  Different Subscription plans are available to support different types of businesses, for instance, one-time event promotors, seasonal businesses, or businesses which are multi-site.  You can click the “Check out our subscription plans” to re-subscribe or upgrade your Subscription at any time if you want to increase the number of Promotions, or Geofences you wish to use for your promotion.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/subscriptionPlan.png" />
 
 <h4 class="subtitle">Brand Identity & Contact Profiles</h4>
 <span class="description">Brand Identity represents an important part of the Offer that is delivered to consumers using the Venubox mobile app.  It enables them to instantly identify your brand and associate you with the Promotional Offer that has been delivered.  This image is seen alongside your Offer, within the Offer Inbox in the Venubox mobile app.  So, make it a strong brand image.  Square images work best and show your branding more clearly for mobile app users.  Use the highest resolution image you can, e.g., an image with a higher number of pixels.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/brandIdentity1.png" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" />
 <h5 class="section-title">Setting up a Brand Identity</h5>
 <span class="description">Click the “Brand Identity” icon to open the Brand Identity screen.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/brandIdentity1.png" />
 <span class="description">Click “Add” to upload a new image.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/brandIdentity2.png" />
 <span class="description">You can either drag and drop a file from your computer into the white window to upload automatically, or you can click “Browse Files”.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/browseFiles1.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">This enables you to browse your computer to find a file location and upload the image to the Venubox Web Portal.  Select the desired image file, and then click open.  Most image files, e.g. .jpg, .bmp, .bmp, etc. are supported.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/browseFiles2.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">You can click in the description and label the image more appropriately.  In the below example, I have changed my file name from “VENUBOX-02.png” to “Brand Identity 1”, as I might need multiple identities, if I have branding for multiple sites to consider.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/brandIdentity3.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">The number of Brand Identities you can create will be limited, based on the Subscription package you signed up to.  The Home Dashboard will show you how many you have used within your Subscription package.</span>
 <h5 class="section-title">Setting up a Contact Profile</h5>
 <span class="description">A Contact Profile is essential to effectively use the integrated chat messaging capability that the Venubox consumer mobile app provides.  It will enable you to setup various profiles, for example, “Bookings”, “Customer Service”, etc. or represent different types of offers if you have a business that provides multiple service, for instance, one site which comprises of a Restaurant, Bar and Nightclub – and where you want to separate inbound consumer enquiries via Chat.</span>
 <span class="description">Click the “Brand Identity” icon to open the Brand Identity screen.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/brandIdentity1.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">Click “Add” to upload a new image.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/addChatContactProfiles.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">You can either drag and drop a file from your computer into the white window to upload automatically, or you can click “Browse Files”.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/browseFiles1.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">This enables you to browse your computer to find a file location and upload the image to the Venubox Web Portal.  Select the desired image file, and then click open.  Most image files, e.g. .jpg, .bmp, .bmp, etc. are supported.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/browseFiles2.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">You can click in the description and label the image more appropriately.  In the below example, I have changed my file name from “VENUBOX-02.png” to “Customer Service”, as I might need multiple Contact Profiles, as mentioned earlier, e.g. Restaurant, Bar or Nightclub if your business provides all of these on one location, so you can separate Chats.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/addChatContactProfilesCustomer.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">The number of Chat profiles you can create will be limited, based on the Subscription package you signed up to.  The Home Dashboard will show you how many you have used within your Subscription package.</span>

 <h4 class="subtitle">Geofences</h4>
 <span class="description">A geofence is a virtual perimeter that can be defined, which enables you to deliver Offers to consumers using the Venubox mobile app when they enter a specific location, for instance the location of your business.</span>
 <h5 class="section-title">Setting up a Geofence</h5>
 <span class="description">Click the “Geofences” icon to open the Geofences screen.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences1.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">Click “Add” to create a new Geofence.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences2.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">Type a location name, or enter a postcode, for instance for the local Bus or Train Station or the physical location of your business. Then click the magnifying glass to Search.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences3.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">The radius depicts the size of the geofence, in other words, the larger the radius, the wider your target audience whilst consumers are in the vicinity of your location.  It defaults to 200 metres; however, you can enter a custom size up to a maximum of 500 metres by clicking and typing “500” into the radius box to increase its size.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences4.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">Be sure to type a useful name for your Geofence, as it will default to whatever your Search term was, for instance, the location of your business.  When you define your Offer in the guide that follows, this is how you will search to find your Geofence to associate it with your Promotional Offer.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences5.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">Click “Create” to save and exit the Geofence screen.  The Geofence dashboard should now show your saved Geofence.  The number of Geofences you can use at any time in Live campaigns, will be limited, based on the Subscription package you signed up to.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/geofences6.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" />
 <span class="description">The Home Dashboard will show you how many you have used within your Subscription package.</span>

 <h4 class="subtitle">Offers</h4>
 <span class="description">An Offer (or Promotional Offer) is like a digital flyer, or email message, but is delivered into the Offer inbox in the Venubox consumer mobile app when the user:</span>
 <span class="description" style="margin-left: 30px;">a)  Specifies interests that match your business category;</span>
 <span class="description" style="margin-left: 30px;">b)	They trigger a Geofence you associate with your Offer, based on their physical location which is tracked through the mobile app.</span>
 <h5 class="section-title">Setting up an Offer</h5>
 <span class="description">Click the “Offers” icon to open the Geofences screen.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers1.png" />
 <span class="description">Click “Add” to create a new Offer.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers2.png" />
 <span class="description" style="text-decoration: underline;">Campaign Properties</span>
 <span class="description">The Campaign properties panel on the left-hand side enables you to specify the important rules around when you offer becomes live, and how long it is valid for.  It also helps you to add labels to identify it, as well as associate it with a contact Profile for any inbound consumer enquiries and the Geofence, to trigger the Offer to consumers using the Venubox mobile app.</span>
 <span class="description">Firstly, you need to enter a “Name” for your Offer.  Make it something unique, but that you can identify with, for instance Friday Happy Hour.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers3.png" />
 <span class="description">Specify a Start Date for the Campaign using the calendar wizard.  This specifies the date from which the Offer will be Live.  By default, the earliest date you can set of course is today, but you can set it to start at a future date.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers4.png" style="margin-top: 20px;" />
 <span class="description">Specify an End Date for the Campaign using the calendar wizard.  This specifies the date from which the Offer will cease to be Live.  By default, the earliest date you can set of course has to be at least one day later than your defined Start Date, but you can set it to end at any future date.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers5.png" style="margin-top: 20px;" />
 <span class="description">If you only want you offer to be available between specific hours, which in this example for Happy Hour, we do, we can specify a valid time range for the Offer – in this instance for between 6pm and 7pm to get people leaving work to come for drinks earlier, during a quieter period.  Please note that times are in 24-hour format, e.g., 06:00 is 6am, 18:00 is 6pm.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers6.png" />
 <span class="description">Select a Geofence to associate with your offer.  Do this by selecting one from the drop-down menu.  All Geofences that you have defined will be available in the drop-down list.  If you have not yet created one, click Create to exit and save your Offer, create a Geofence and then return to your Offer and edit it.  In this instance, I have selected the Geofence I setup earlier in this tutorial.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers7.png" />
 <span class="description">Next select a Contact Profile to associate with your Offer.  By default, when we deliver your Offer to a user of the Venubox mobile app, a CONTACT button is included at the bottom.  This when clicked enables them to send a Chat message directly to your venue via the Web Portal.  Select an existing Chat Profile you wish to use. If you have not yet created one, click Create to exit and save your Offer, create a Contact Profile under the Brand Identity screen and then return to your Offer and edit it.  In this instance, I have selected the Contact Profile I setup earlier in this tutorial.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers8.png"  />
 <span class="description">Choose a Brand Identity image to associate with the Offer, when it appears in the users inbox.  Click “Choose Image” to select a predefined Brand Identity, or choose “Upload Image” to upload a new one.  The image uploaded will automatically be added under the Brand Identity section of the web portal, for future re-use.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers9.png" />
 <span class="description" style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Templates</span>
 <span class="description">The simplest and easiest way to create Offers is to use one of our provided templates.  That way with just a little customization, such as adding your logo, or changing colours, you have an Offer ready to go in no time at all.</span>
 <span class="description">To use a Template, simply click the Templates button on the top right hand side of the Offer screen.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers10.png" />
 <span class="description">This exposes some templates that are readily available.  We will be adding more template varieties for users in due course.  Hover over a template to see its thumbnail scroll through the creative.  Click it to select the template and load it.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers11.png" />
 <span class="description">The loaded template looks like the following.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers12.png" />
 <span class="description">To change items, such as the logo for instance, simply click on the logo icon. On the right hand side, a property box appears where you can click Upload Image.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers13.png" />
 <span class="description">A window appears that enables you to browse on your computer to select an image to upload by clicking the Open button.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers14.png" />
 <span class="description">The image is then replaced as you can see before.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers15.png" />
 <span class="description">The image by default is set to auto width, meaning it will span automatically the entire width of the screen.  You do have controls though if you want to make the image you import smaller.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers16.png" />
 <span class="description">Clicking the green Auto Width toggle above, enables manual controls to be defined.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers17.png" />
 <span class="description">Adjusting the size of the image is done simply via dragging the slider.  Below you can see how the image looks when it is reduced to 80% to sit nicely in the template.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers18.png" />
 <span class="description" style="text-decoration: underline;">Changing Colours</span>
 <span class="description">It may be that you want to change colours to suit your branding, and this is easily achieved.  First, simply select the text you want to change the colour on as per below.  This then display the properties of the selected item in the right-hand panel.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers19.png" />
 <span class="description">Clicking in the box colour enables you to select a colour using the sliders close to your branding, or enter the specific colour using either Hex or RGB settings.  Hex is typically used online for colour definitions, and RGB adjusts the amount of Red Blue and Green to find the right colour.  Below I have selected a colour that closely resembles the Venubox red branding.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers20.png" />
 <span class="description">Changing Buttons (or CTA / Call to Action) buttons are exactly the same process as that outlined above.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers21.png" />
 <span class="description">Changing fonts / typefaces is simple too, to ensure they meet your brand needs.  Select the text for which you want to change the font for, as per below, and the right-hand panel enables you to change it under the font family drop down menu.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers22.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" />
 <h5 class="section-title">Setting up an Offer without a Template</h5>
 <span class="description">Our drag and drop editor make it very simple for users to create new Offers from scratch, without having to have any kind of HTML coding skills.</span>
 <span class="description">When you first create a new Offer, the Offer itself will be blank in the mid-section of the screen, and to the right, you will see a range of what we call “Tools” to help you to build your Promotional Offer from scratch.</span>
 <img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers23.png" />
 <span class="description">Below is a summary of each of the tools, and how they function to help you craft beautiful Offers to entice and engage Venubox mobile app users that receive them.</span>

 <table border = "1">
  <tr>
    <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px; font-weight: bold;">Tool</td>
    <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px; font-weight: bold;">When to Use</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
     <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Columns</td>
     <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">Columns enable you to add structure to your Offer.  Think of it the same of columns of a newspaper.  You can have one column (full width) of your page or break it into sections.  Prebuilt column structures are available for you to simply drag and drop into your Offer, in the middle of your screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Divider</td>
     <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This tool simply puts a line and default spacing between items of content, and is useful for separating things, such as a Promotion you are sending that may have multiple Offers for the Venubox mobile app user to consider.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Heading</td>
    <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This is important for making a bold and clear statement around the Offer that you are making.  Typically, this tool is one of the first things that you would include in the top of your Offer, for instance <span style="font-weight: bold;">Friday night Happy Hour</span>.  If a user has received several Offers, this will help yours stand out, so make the words eye catching and stand out from the crowd!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">HTML</td>
   <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This tool is only for advanced users.  It enables you to add custom HTML code within the template.  If you are a coder of HTML. You likely won’t need instructions for using this feature.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Image</td>
  <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This tool enables you to add any image you desire to your email.  Simply drag the tool in, click in the clock it creates and click Upload Image to browse and import an image to use.  Auto Width will make it fit the width of your Offer message, but you can disable this, clicking the green slider in the properties, and then use the slider to reduce your image size if required.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Menu</td>
  <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This tool is typically used at the top of the Offer and can be used to create a list of items (or pages) on your website and associate them with links.  This is common in email marketing but may add “noise” to your Offer compared with brands that are delivering clear, concise Offers.  If you want to use it, drag the tool to your Offer in the mid-section, then in the properties on the right-hand side click “Add new Item”.  Add “Text” (e.g., Bookings) and then a URL <a href="www.mywebsite.com/bookings" target="_blank">www.mywebsite.com/bookings</a>(e.g., www.mywebsite.com/bookings).  Repeat the process to build your menu.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class="table-td" style="width: 200px;">Text</td>
  <td class="table-td" style="padding:5px;">This tool is one of the most commonly used, and simply allows you to add text to your Offer, which is pretty important for positioning it.  Simply drag the tool in, double click the default text and type the messaging you want to use.  The simple rich text editor menu that appears enables you to change the font, size, make it bold or Italic or apply other formatting changes, like any standard word processing package.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<span class="description">If you want to change the background colour from the default light grey that is easy too.  Simply click the “Body” icon in the far-right hand side to the properties box, and click in background colour.  You can change it to either plain white, or use your brand colour, with contrasting text colours to make your Offer stand out.</span>
<span class="description">When your Offer is finished and you click Create you will return to the Offer dashboard, where all Offers you have defined, and their Status is displayed as per below.</span>
<img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers24.png" />
<h5 class="section-title">Editing an “existing” Offer</h5>
<span class="description">You may want to edit an existing Offer, perhaps because you want to extend its run period (e.g., End Date) or perhaps because you exited it before completing its setup.  Either way, there are two ways of achieving this.</span>
<span class="description">Method 1: From the Home Dashboard, click the  icon to direct edit it from within the Recent Promotions list as per below.</span>
<img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers25.png" />
<span class="description">Method 2 – From the Home Dashboard click the Offers icon as per below from the Activities section.</span>
<img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers1.png" />
<span class="description">This launches the Offers dashboard, where you can click the   icon in order to edit the Offer as per below.</span>
<img src="../../../../assets/img/help/offers26.png" />
